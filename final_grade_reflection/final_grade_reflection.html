<p>I believe I deserve an A+.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Extended Thinking:</strong></p>
<p>evidence: supporting_artifacts &gt; extended_learning</p>
<p>I demonstrated extending my learning in the various challenge assignments by applying the skills we learned in class in new ways on the Challenges. In Challenge 9 “Spelling By State” Question 1, I applied what Dr.&nbsp;Theobold taught in class about incorporating the legend colors into the title rather than having a separate legend. The titles in the graphs are more readable by having a descriptive main title and eliminating the x and y-axis titles. Additionally in this challenge, I researched the DT, kable, and kableExtra packages to see how to apply the different features (cell-border stripe, captions, renaming column names) to the tables in the assignment in order to create clear and appealing tables. In Challenge 4 “Plots”, I researched how to find correlations to create a stronger argument on whether there was a relationship between CA housing prices and avocado prices and avocado volumes. I discovered moderndive, and was able to use get_correlation to find correlation coefficient within a pipeline in tidyverse. In Challenge 2 Question 10, I attempted all 3 levels because they all taught me something new about ggplot2, and I wanted to learn more about colors, shapes, and annotations in plots since I find that very fascinating. In this challenge, I extended my thinking by learning about all the different color palettes I can use and created my own color palette to use through hex numbers. If there were more than one options for challenges, I would attempt them, and enjoyed making my documents creative through different colors and themes.</p>
<p><strong>Revising Thinking</strong></p>
<p>evidence: supporting_artifacts &gt; continued_learning</p>
<p>I show my ability to revise my thinking through submitting revisions on labs and challenges that receive G or receive an S but have comments on improvement. I also revise my thinking by reflecting on these mistakes and comments. In the Revisions Markdown file in the ‘continued_learning’ folder there are examples of the mistakes I made in labs and challenges, and what I learned from fixing these mistakes in my reflections. I chose the revisions from Lab 4 and Challenge 3 because these were artifacts where I had to revise multiple times, and I am proud of the revised results I was able to get at the end. These artifacts show my growth in the skills from these assignments, as I was able to solidify my understanding in pivots, joins, mutating, summarizing, group by, and slicing. These artifacts showed that I first attempted to revise the problems I got wrong by looking at my notes and previous assignments to find information on the skills I need to fix. When I still got the problems wrong a second time, I went to office hours to understand what I was doing wrong and attempt to fix the problems with Dr.&nbsp;Theobold. By revising my code, I was able to prevent repeating the same mistake in future labs. Along with revising the code, I submit reflections discussing what I fixed, my understanding of my mistake, and how the new solution fixes the issue. These reflections have helped me understand my previous thought process when solving the problem and how the new code is a better solution.</p>
<p><strong>Growth As A Team Member</strong></p>
<p>evidence: supporting_artifacts &gt; growth_team_member</p>
<p>I have grown as a team member by working together with my team to solve each question in the Practice Activities. I have listened to my teammates when they have questions, and try my best to support and help them find the answer. During class I ask Dr.&nbsp;Theobold and Bella team questions and then continue to work together with my team from the sugestions we receive. I was able to support my classmates by answering questions on labs, challenges, and anything else related to 331 on my team’s group chat. In ‘GroupChatHelping1-4’, I help my classmates by explaining what I did to solve the problems they have questions on. I also have been able to answer a classmate’s questions on Discord as seen in ‘AnsweringDiscordQuestionLab7’, where there was confusion as to why the graph looked ‘ugly’, and I had noticed an error in their mutate code. I have also asked questions on Discord to clarify parts of labs that hopefully help other students who have similar questions, as seen in ‘AskingQuestionOnDiscord_1-2’. Additionally, I have grown as a team member by putting my best effort to provide feedback on the tidiness and efficiency of a classmate’s code, making sure to provide praise on something that was done well and provide constructive criticism as seen in ‘Lab3-4_PeerCodeReview’ . I have contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning environment by listening and not judging other students’ questions, as they can be clearing up confusions me and other students may have, and being being kind and respectful to my classmates.</p>
<p><strong>Attention to Personal Goals</strong></p>
<p>At the start of the course, I wanted to be open-minded when learning the language R as coding can be difficult, and it is important to be patient and learn multiple different ways to solve problems. I believe that I was successful in staying open-minded and patient while I have been learning R and participating in the class, as I take the time to learn the new skills from Preview Activities. I also asked questions to the professor, the learning assistant, and other students to make sure I understand the topics. As the topics got harder, I made sure to allocate more time towards the class to understand the notes, videos, and lecture slides. When I came across questions, I made sure to ask them right away to prevent any doubts from lingering. I also am proud with how much I learned over this quarter and how I was able to still have fun with my assignments especially through making the quarto files have a theme I liked and incorporating different colors and styles to make the file look more appealing.</p>
