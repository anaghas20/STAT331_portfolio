I believe that concepts of collaboration, failure, creativity, logical thinking, and asking for help are important in data science. Through a few main artifacts, I was able to grow in these areas mentioned above and helped me to become a better data scientist. I believe Lab 4 shows my growth as a Data Scientist because this was the most difficult Lab for me, and I believe that the experience I went through to complete and revise this lab really embodies what data science is. In this lab I experienced not understanding the question properly resulting in submitting the code that was incorrect and needed to be revised, as it did not answer the question correctly. I also experienced collaborating with my classmates to better understand the lab. While completing this lab, my classmates and I were explaining our own thought process for answering the questions and trying to improve from each others ideas. This lab also demonstrates asking for help, as I went to office hours to understand from my mistakes and collaborate with Dr. Theobold and another classmate to solve Question 6 and 7 in Lab 4. From this experience, I was able to properly understand a concept that I was struggling with (pivoting datasets), and gain confidence in using it correctly in future labs. From this lab, I was able to improve on my creativity and logical thinking, as I had the right ideas in Lab 4 but struggled with implementing them. After this lab, I struggled less with figuring out the correct skills to use and was able to implement our class concepts in the future labs better.
