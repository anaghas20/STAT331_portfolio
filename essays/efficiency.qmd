As we\'ve said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term \"efficiency\" means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Include:

What is the definition of \"efficiency\"?

What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science?

What does efficiency allow you to do?

Why is efficiency important?

Where did you encounter efficiency, and

what were some [\"a-ha\" moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency?

(For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)

Efficiency is being productive and successful without having to lose a lot of time or effort. In statistical computing, being efficient can refer to writing code that does not repeat or is more confusing than it has to be. Being efficient in statistical computing can result in writing functions and using iteration to prevent repetition. It can also refer to using the most up-to-date functions to make sure that proper code is being run.

Being efficient in statistical computing allows one code to run faster and better, and it allows others who read your code to understand it more easily as it most likely will be shorter without any unnecessary repetition or complicated code

Some a-ha moments I had with efficient was early on in the quarter where we learned about pipelines. This reduced the amount of times we would have to repeat using the data frame as we could combine all the functions we wanted to apply on the dataframe in one pipeline.
